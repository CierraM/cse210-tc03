# Hilo
How much are you willing to lose? Play <i>HiLo</i> to find out! The rules are 
simple. The dealer draws a new card. You guess if the next one will be higher or 
lower. Earn 100 points if you're right. Lose 75 if you're wrong. End the game at 
any time or just keep playing. Watch out though. Lose all your points and the 
game is ended for you!
