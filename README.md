Tracy Benjamin Fernelius
I was born and raised in Las Vegas to a family of seven. My favorite hobbies are practicing and competing in Taekwondo and playing basketball. Additionally, I enjoy studying Japanese in my free time. I served a mission in the Tokyo, Japan mission and hope to return there someday to work as a programmer of sorts.
